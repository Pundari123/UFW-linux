# UFW-linux
In my view, I checked UFW status, enabled it, listed numbered rules, denied inbound 23/tcp to block Telnet, tested with `nc` (localhost and remote), ensured SSH was allowed with `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`, then removed the test deny rule and verified rules—documenting each command and output.
